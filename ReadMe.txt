If you want see the secondary structure and parse tree for a certain sequence:
    1. Open predict_with_cfg.py in you favorite editor/IDE
    2. Change the sequence variable in the function named main to your rna sequences
    3. Run predict_with_cfg.py

If you want to produce some graphs for the timing
    1. Open measure_time_complexity.py in your favorite editor/IDE
    2. OPTIONAL: Change the lengths of sequences you want to test
    3. OPTIONAL: Change the amount of times each length is run
    4. Run measure_time_complexity.py
    5. Your graphs will be found in ./output/
